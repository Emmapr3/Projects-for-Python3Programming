        "This project is related to implementing a simplified version of the game *Wheel of Fortune*. In this game, there may be two types of players: Human players and Computer players. The human player must type their move (through the python's input function) according to game development. The computer player gets its move according to how good it is at playing (the feature of difficulty).\n",

        "\n",
        "* The **Class WOFPlayer** represents a Wheel of Fortune Player. Every instance of *WOFPlayer* has three instance variables: *name*, *prizeMoney* and *prizes*. Aditionally, it should have the following methods: *addMoney(amt)*, *gobankrup()* and *addPrizes(prize)*.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The **Class WOFHumanPlayer** inherits the previous class and represent a human player that plays through the prompt. Also, it adds a method for requesting a valid move.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The **Class WOFComputerPlayer** is the most interesting. Also, it inherits the parent class WOFPlayer and adds one instance variable to the player: the *difficulty*. Computer player with a higher difficulty generally plays \"better\". This difficulty is between 1 (easier opponent) and 10 (harder opponent). To decide if the Computer player makes a \"good\" or \"bad\" move, a semi-randomly process is used. A \"bad\" move refers to a random decision on possible letters. In a \"good\" move, a letter according to their overall frequency in the English language is chosen. To do this last, a class variable 'SORTED_FREQUENCIES' might be included, where 'SORTED_FREQUENCIES = ZQXJKVBPYGFWMUCLDRHSNIOATE' is the list of English characters sorted from the least frequent (Z) to the most frequent (E). In this class, *smartCoinFlip()* method is used to decide if the Computer player makes a bad or good move according to its difficulty level: choosing a random number between 1 and 10, if this number is lesser or equal than its difficulty then the player makes a good move, otherwise makes a bad move. Moreover, the *getPossibleLetters(guessed)* method returns a list of letters that can be guessed, considering the letters already guessed and whether the player has enough money to guess vowels (*moneyPrize*>=*VOWEL_COST*). For the player to make a good or bad move, this list of possible letters to guess must be considered. \n",
