The TasteDive API lets you provide a movie (or bands, TV shows, etc.) as a query input, and returns a set of related items. The OMDB API lets you provide a movie title as a query input and get back data about the movie, including scores from various review sites (IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, etc.).\n","\n","TasteDive is used to get related movies for a whole list of titles. One will combine the resulting lists of related movies, and sort them according to their rating scores assigned by a Rating source (which will require making API calls to the OMDB API.); this Rating source can be IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic.\n","\n","To understand the request URL, you can take a look at the APIs documentation:\n","*  TasteDive: https://tastedive.com/read/api\n","*  OMDB: https://www.omdbapi.com/\n","\n","One can make a few requests to experiment with the TasteDive API, but f you want to use the API several times, you must to <a href='https://tastedive.com/account/signin'>request an access key</a> and you can perform 300 requests per hour. On another side, to make requests to the OMDB API you need to obtain a <a href='necessarily'>access key</a> necessarily.\n","\n","\n","**To overcome the project's task, I follow the next steps:**\n","* First, I define a function to get the movie titles related to the given movie title from the tasteDive API. With this function, one can set a defined number of related titles. The requests to the API are made with the **request** module and the responses are in JSON format. Therefore, the responses are converted to python dictionaries with the **json** module. **get_movies_from_tastedive** function.\n","*  Second, I define a function to extract only the movie titles from the request's response in the first step like a list. **extract_movie_titles** function.\n","*  Third, I define a function that takes a list of movie titles and returns a list of related movie titles using the two previous functions. It is possible that two or more movie titles of the given list have the same related titles. The final returned list by this function omitted these repeated titles. **get_related_titles** function.\n","*   Fourth, to get information about all obtained related titles, I define a function to get info for each movie title from the OMDB API. To avoid repeated web requests, I used a dictionary (**cache_dict**) to store the information of movies that have been previously requested as a cache file in the memory. **get_movie_data** function.\n","*  Fifth, I define a function to extract the rating score assigned by one of the three rating sources. This info is obtained by the data movie obtained in the fourth step. If the source rating doesn't have a rating score, then the rating score becomes zero. **get_movie_rating**\n","* Finally, I define a function to make a list of sorted recommended movies related to the given list of movie titles. The classification of the recommendations is based on the rating for each movie. On this function, you can choose your prefered Rating source: IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic. **get_sorted_recommendations** function.\n","\n","To compare the Rating sources, on the final cell code I generate a list of recommendations related to the same list of movies with different Rating sources.\n","\n","\n","With this project, I obtained my <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/SX2JDSUCNYCN\">course certification</a>, showing my abilities to get and manage information by APIs REST with python."],"metadata":{"id":"-hSYd_2YYrw9"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"4oanFuEFYqx4"},"outputs":[],"source":["import requests\n","import json\n","\n","cache_dict = {} #dictionary to save the cache data from the OMDB API in the internal memory"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def get_movies_from_tastedive(q_string, q_type = 'movies', q_limit = 5):\n","    '''This function return the q_limit results from the TasteDive API of type q_types\n","    that are similar titles to the string q_string.
