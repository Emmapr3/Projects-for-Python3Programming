# Projects for the Specialization Program: Python 3 Programming
Here there are the projects to conclude the Specialization program "<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming">Python 3 Programming</a>" by the University of Michigan through Coursera.org

On these projects, I show several skills to collect and manage different data types with python, from extracting information stored as strings to collecting information from APIs REST and extracting specific data.

Within each project notebook, you can find a hold description for the project's tasks. Next, I make a brief description for each one.


## [Project 1: Strings Managment](Project1_StringsManagement.ipynb)
The first project is named "Strings Management", which consists of a series of tasks to extract, accumulate and gather data together from strings. Take scores from a string, make acronyms to organization names or popular phrases, determine if a sentence is a palindrome and show articles information on specific format is what you will find in this notebook.

## [Project 2: Sentiments Classifier](Project2_SentimentsClassifier.ipynb)
"Sentiments Classifier" is the name of the second project. The task is to build a sentiment classifier for tweets, which will detect how positive or negative each one is. Taking a list of words that reflect positive or negative sentiments, several text tweets are analyzed to assign them a net score and determine if the tweet expresses positive or negative sentiments. With this analysis about the sentiment of tweets, you can obtain visual relations between the Net Score of the tweet and its number of Retweets like the next figure:

On this project, there are text cleaning and management of TXT and CVS files without extra module. The next files are part:

- [project_twitter_data.cvs](project_twitter_data.cvs)
- [positive_words.txt](positive_words.txt)
- [negative_words.txt](negative_words.txt)

## [Project 3: OMDB and TasteDive Mashup](Project3_OMDB-TasteDive-Mashup.ipynb)
"OMDB and TasteDive Mashup" is called the third project. This project builds mashup data from two different APIs to make movie recommendations: <a href='https://tastedive.com/read/api'>TasteDive API</a> and <a href='https://www.omdbapi.com/'>OMDB API</a>. Given a list of movie titles, you can obtain a list of recommended titles that are related to all movies on the input list and the order of the output list is according to the movies' rating score. The rating score could be taken by three suppliers: IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. The results show us that the classification of related recommendations is dependent on the rating score supplier.

Data collection from the APIs REST, processing of JSON format and python dictionaries and extraction of specific data from dictionaries is what you will find in this work.

## [Project 4: Wheel of Fortune](Project4_WheelOfFortune.ipynb)
"Wheel of Fortune" is named the fourth project. In this project, the popular game 'Wheel of Fortune' is implemented using definitions of classes in python for two types of players: Human players and Computer Players. The human players must pay attention to the evolution of the game to win, so only type their move through the prompt. The computer players play guessing letters as the game progress; to do this, their 'difficulty' as an added feature allows them to make 'good' or 'bad' moves. In this project's notebook, you can play this game with friends or versus the computer players (you decide their difficulty ;) ) and win amazing prizes.

Definition of classes in python and the use of inheritance to reuse classes is what you can see in this work. The next files are part of this project:

- [wheel.json](wheel.json)
- [phrases.json](phrases.json)
